<h1>The Best Movies According to Srijan</h1>
<h2>My Best Three Movies Of All-Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Gajani</h3>
<p> This is the best movie I have ever watched, based on a lover who was killed by a gang then her physco boyfriend took her revange.</p>
<h3>Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jainge</h3>
<p>Probably the best Bollywood movie out there and one of my favourate. This is basically a love story acted by Sharukh Khan as Raj and Kajol as Simran charactar.</p>
<h3>Batman (2005,2007,2009)</h3>
<p>These are three different movies based on same story, Batman, hero who's saving his town. This is also one of the best Hollywood movie.</p>
